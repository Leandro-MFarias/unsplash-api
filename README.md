<h2>📜 Project Description</h2>

<p>
  Welcome to CineVault!  

  CineVault is a project that simulates a streaming platform, designed to showcase popular and trending movies, powered by The Movie Database (TMDB) API.

  I developed this application using React, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS, along with @tanstack/react-query for efficient data fetching and management.
